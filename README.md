winPACT is a plugin for EEGLAB developed by Makoto Miyakoshi. It performs sliding-window phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) analysis to obtain Canolty's Modulation Index (MI), normalized MI, and KL divergence based on Tort et al. (2011). The plugin also comes with a simulator with which one can evaluate the effect of sliding window length on the final PAC measure.
